     used to find keywords in every news, specific methods to get keywords were not written by myself instand of borrowing from yake (https://github.com/LIAAD/yake).
     after get keywords, I divided every news into three parts———— the fist 1/5 paragraphes as the beginning, the middle 3/5 paragraphes as the main story, the latter 1/5 as the ending.
     so I get three parts of keywords from every news, and then I used them to get answers used Indri.
